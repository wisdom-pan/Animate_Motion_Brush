# 📷 EasyAnimate | An End-to-End Solution for High-Resolution and Long Video Generation
😊 EasyAnimate is an end-to-end solution for generating high-resolution and long videos. We can train transformer based diffusion generators, train VAEs for processing long videos, and preprocess metadata. 

😊 Based on Sora like structure and DIT, we use transformer as a diffuser for video generation. We built easyanimate based on motion module, u-vit and slice-vae. In the future, we will try more training programs to improve the effect.

😊 Welcome!

# Introduction
EasyAnimate is a pipeline based on the transformer architecture that can be used to generate AI photos and videos, train baseline models and Lora models for the Diffusion Transformer. We support making predictions directly from the pre-trained EasyAnimate model to generate videos of about different resolutions, 6 seconds with 24 fps (1 ~ 144 frames, in the future, we will support longer videos). Users are also supported to train their own baseline models and Lora models to perform certain style transformations. 

We will support quick pull-ups from different platforms, refer to [Quick Start](#quick-start).

# How to use

<h3 id="video-gen">1. Inference </h3>

#### a. Using Python Code
- Step 1: Download the corresponding [weights](#model-zoo) and place them in the models folder.
- Step 2: Modify prompt, neg_prompt, guidance_scale, and seed in the predict_t2v.py file.
- Step 3: Run the predict_t2v.py file, wait for the generated results, and save the results in the samples/easyanimate-videos folder.
- Step 4: If you want to combine other backbones you have trained with Lora, modify the predict_t2v.py and Lora_path in predict_t2v.py depending on the situation.

#### b. Using webui
- Step 1: Download the corresponding [weights](#model-zoo) and place them in the models folder.
- Step 2: Run the app.py file to enter the graph page.
- Step 3: Select the generated model based on the page, fill in prompt, neg_prompt, guidance_scale, and seed, click on generate, wait for the generated result, and save the result in the samples folder.

### 2. Model Training
A complete EasyAnimate training pipeline should include data preprocessing, Video VAE training, and Video DiT training. Among these, Video VAE training is optional because we have already provided a pre-trained Video VAE.

<h4 id="data-preprocess">a. data preprocessing</h4>

We have provided a simple demo of training the Lora model through image data, which can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/aigc-apps/EasyAnimate/wiki/Training-Lora) for details.

A complete data preprocessing link for long video segmentation, cleaning, and description can refer to [README](./easyanimate/video_caption/README.md) in the video captions section. 

If you want to train a text to image and video generation model. You need to arrange the dataset in this format.

```
📦 project/
├── 📂 datasets/
│   ├── 📂 internal_datasets/
│       ├── 📂 videos/
│       │   ├── 📄 00000001.mp4
│       │   ├── 📄 00000001.jpg
│       │   └── 📄 .....
│       └── 📄 json_of_internal_datasets.json
```

The json_of_internal_datasets.json is a standard JSON file. The file_path in the json can to be set as relative path, as shown in below:
```json
[
    {
      "file_path": "videos/00000001.mp4",
      "text": "A group of young men in suits and sunglasses are walking down a city street.",
      "type": "video"
    },
    {
      "file_path": "train/00000001.jpg",
      "text": "A group of young men in suits and sunglasses are walking down a city street.",
      "type": "image"
    },
    .....
]
```

You can also set the path as absolute path as follow:
```json
[
    {
      "file_path": "/mnt/data/videos/00000001.mp4",
      "text": "A group of young men in suits and sunglasses are walking down a city street.",
      "type": "video"
    },
    {
      "file_path": "/mnt/data/train/00000001.jpg",
      "text": "A group of young men in suits and sunglasses are walking down a city street.",
      "type": "image"
    },
    .....
]
```

<h4 id="vae-train">b. Video VAE training (optional)</h4>

Video VAE training is an optional option as we have already provided pre trained Video VAEs.
If you want to train video vae, you can refer to [README](easyanimate/vae/README.md) in the video vae section.

<h4 id="dit-train">c. Video DiT training </h4>
 
If the data format is relative path during data preprocessing, please set ```scripts/train.sh``` as follow.
```
export DATASET_NAME="datasets/internal_datasets/"
export DATASET_META_NAME="datasets/internal_datasets/json_of_internal_datasets.json"
```

If the data format is absolute path during data preprocessing, please set ```scripts/train.sh``` as follow.
```
export DATASET_NAME=""
export DATASET_META_NAME="/mnt/data/json_of_internal_datasets.json"
```

Then, we run scripts/train.sh.
```sh
sh scripts/train.sh
```

# Algorithm Detailed
### 1. Data Preprocessing
**Video Cut**

For long video cut, EasyAnimate utilizes PySceneDetect to identify scene changes within the video and performs scene cutting based on certain threshold values to ensure consistency in the themes of the video segments. After cutting, we only keep segments with lengths ranging from 3 to 10 seconds for model training.

**Video Cleaning and Description**

Following SVD's data preparation process, EasyAnimate provides a simple yet effective data processing pipeline for high-quality data filtering and labeling. It also supports distributed processing to accelerate the speed of data preprocessing. The overall process is as follows:

- Duration filtering: Analyze the basic information of the video to filter out low-quality videos that are short in duration or low in resolution.
- Aesthetic filtering: Filter out videos with poor content (blurry, dim, etc.) by calculating the average aesthetic score of uniformly distributed 4 frames.
- Text filtering: Use easyocr to calculate the text proportion of middle frames to filter out videos with a large proportion of text.
- Motion filtering: Calculate interframe optical flow differences to filter out videos that move too slowly or too quickly.
- Text description: Recaption video frames using videochat2 and vila. PAI is also developing a higher quality video recaption model, which will be released for use as soon as possible.

### 2. Model Architecture
We have adopted [PixArt-alpha](https://github.com/PixArt-alpha/PixArt-alpha) as the base model and modified the VAE and DiT model structures on this basis to better support video generation. The overall structure of EasyAnimate is as follows:

The diagram below outlines the pipeline of EasyAnimate. It includes the Text Encoder, Video VAE (video encoder and decoder), and Diffusion Transformer (DiT). The T5 Encoder is used as the text encoder. Other components are detailed in the sections below.

<img src="https://pai-aigc-photog.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/easyanimate/asset/pipeline_v3.jpg" alt="ui" style="zoom:50%;" />

We have expanded the DiT framework originally designed for 2D image synthesis to accommodate the complexities of 3D video generation by incorporating a special motion module block named Hybrid Motion Module. 

In the motion module, we employ a combination of temporal attention and global attention to ensure the generation of coherent frames and seamless motion transitions.

Additionally, referencing U-ViT, it introduces a skip connection structure into EasyAnimate to further optimize deeper features by incorporating shallow features. A fully connected layer is also zero-initialized for each skip connection structure, allowing it to be applied as a plug-in module to previously trained and well-performing DiTs.

Moreover, it proposes Slice VAE, which addresses the memory difficulties encountered by MagViT when dealing with long and large videos, while also achieving greater compression in the temporal dimension during video encoding and decoding stages compared to MagViT.
